# Chef de Cuisine

## Abstract: Summarise the key points of your document.

## Changes: Describe and justify any changes made to the project from what was outlined in the proposal.

You can view the original proposal here: https://github.com/CSSE6400/project-proposal-2025/blob/main/s4955583/proposal.md

There were no changes made to the core functionality of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The project's focus is to deliver all MVP 
features as planned in the original proposal.

However, after a close review during team discussions, it was identified that many quality attributes lacked sufficient 
justification or relevance to the goals of the project at its current stage. As a result, the team mutually agreed to refine 
the quality attributes to include only the three most critical and applicable characterisitics: Availability, Extensibility 
and Scalability.

These attributes were selected based on their direct impact on the system's reliability, long-term adaptibility and capacity 
to serve users efficiently under varying loads.

The reasons to exclude the other attributes are as follows:

**1. Deployability**

**2. Maintainability**

**3. Modularity**

**4. Reliabilty**

**5. Security**

**6. Testability**

This refinement ensures that the architectural and development decisions remain focused and aligned with the MVP.

## Architecture Options: What architectural design patterns were considered and their pros and cons.

## Architecture: Describe the MVPâ€™s software architecture in detail.

## Trade-Offs: Describe and justify the trade-offs made in designing the architecture.

## Critique: Describe how well the architecture supports delivering the complete system.

## Evaluation: Summarise testing results and justify how well the software achieves its quality attributes.

## Reflection: Lessons learnt and what you would do differently.
