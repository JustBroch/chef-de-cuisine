# AI Usage Documentation

This document describes how generative AI tools were used in the development of the Chef de Cuisine project.

## AI Tools Used

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Code generation, debugging, architecture guidance, and documentation
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and inline suggestions during development

## Usage Examples

### Project Setup
Generated initial React TypeScript project structure with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and component templates.

### Component Development  
Created UI components like recipe cards, filter sidebars, and navigation elements with proper TypeScript interfaces.

### Backend Development
Generated Flask API endpoints, database models, and authentication middleware.

### Testing
Created Playwright test suites for end-to-end testing of user interactions.

## Files with AI Assistance

### Frontend
- UI components in `src/components/`
- Page components in `src/pages/`
- Utility functions in `src/lib/`

### Backend
- API endpoints in `backend/app.py`
- Test files in `backend/test/`

### Infrastructure
- Terraform configuration files
- Docker and deployment scripts

### Documentation
- Parts of README.md and technical documentation

## Manual Work

All architectural decisions and design patterns were made by the development team. AI tools were used to implement these decisions, not to make them.

Key manual work included:
- Architecture design and technology choices
- Code review and testing of all AI-generated content
- Business logic and domain-specific requirements
- Security considerations and error handling
- Performance optimization and accessibility improvements

## Verification Process

Every AI-generated code block was manually reviewed, tested, and often significantly modified to meet project requirements and coding standards.
